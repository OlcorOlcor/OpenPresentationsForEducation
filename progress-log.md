# Progress Log

The idea of this file is to keep track of my learning and thought process when developing my app

## 9.10.2023

- Managed to successfully add Marked into the project
- Changed the way the apps works - right now it parses markdown into html and displays it on the right side of the screen
- Learned about React Props and how to correctly pass down functions into child components

## 29.10.2023

- Added mui to the project
- Added a grid layout to App.tsx
- Tried to get a custom extension for marked working, so far without any luck
- To do so I followed marked [official documentation](https://marked.js.org/using_pro)

# Progress Log
The idea of this file is to keep track of my learning and thought process when developing my app
## 9.10.2023
- Managed to successfully add Marked into the project
- Changed the way the apps works - right now it parses markdown into html and displays it on the right side of the screen
- Learned about React Props and how to correctly pass down functions into child components
